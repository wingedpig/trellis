      <h2 class="text-center mb-5">How a Fix Happens</h2>

      <p>Something breaks in production. You open a Claude session, and it can pull logs from your remote hosts, run distributed traces across services, and read crash reports directly—so the investigation starts from real data. You find the root cause, write the fix, and save the whole investigation as a Case—notes, the Claude transcript, the trace report—committed alongside the diff.</p>

      <p>Or you're building a feature. Your local services are running, Trellis restarts them as you rebuild, and you're working through the implementation in a Claude session. When you're done, you capture the design notes and Claude transcript as a Case, so the reasoning lives in the repo with the code.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center mb-5">Why Trellis Exists</h2>

        <p>I built Trellis because the tools I was using to develop <a href="https://groups.io">Groups.io</a> were annoying me.</p>

        <p>Groups.io isn't a weekend project. It's been running for over a decade, has millions of users, and a lot of moving parts. I write the code, run the dev environment, deploy to production, and get woken up when something breaks. The neat "dev vs ops" distinction doesn't really apply—it's just me switching hats all day.</p>

        <p>For years, I glued things together with shell scripts, tmux sessions, and manual steps. It worked, but it was fragile. I'd switch branches, start the services I needed, dig through logs, SSH into production, then jump back to local code. The context lived in my head, and if I lost track, I paid for it.</p>

        <p>I wanted a single workflow—from "I'm writing this code" to "what just broke in production." So I built Trellis.</p>

        <p>Trellis isn't a provisioning system and it doesn't replace your cloud or orchestrator. It becomes your dev environment. It runs your services, restarts them when binaries change, scopes terminals and logs to what you're working on, and keeps everything in sync with the active branch. Switch worktrees, switch your world—without leaving behind a mess of sessions and state.</p>

        <p>I built Trellis for myself. After a while, I realized other people were solving the same problems. So here it is.</p>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h6><i class="fa-solid fa-check text-accent me-2"></i>AI-assisted development</h6>
          <p class="text-muted ms-4">Trellis gives Claude Code a native interface with direct access to your services, logs, and traces. Investigations happen inside the same environment your code runs in—not in a separate chat window with copy-pasted context.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h6><i class="fa-solid fa-check text-accent me-2"></i>Developers who also operate their systems</h6>
          <p class="text-muted ms-4">If you write code and are responsible for keeping it running, Trellis gives you one place to develop, debug, and inspect live systems without switching tools or losing context.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h6><i class="fa-solid fa-check text-accent me-2"></i>Founder-operators and small teams</h6>
          <p class="text-muted ms-4">Trellis fits teams where deep system knowledge matters more than heavy process, and where the same people build, deploy, and debug production.</p>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h6><i class="fa-solid fa-check text-accent me-2"></i>Infra-heavy codebases</h6>
          <p class="text-muted ms-4">Services that run continuously, depend on each other, and fail in interesting ways benefit most from Trellis's service lifecycle management and log-driven introspection.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h6><i class="fa-solid fa-check text-accent me-2"></i>Parallel development workflows</h6>
          <p class="text-muted ms-4">If you use git worktrees or juggle multiple branches at once, Trellis treats each as a first-class environment with isolated services, logs, and workflows.</p>
