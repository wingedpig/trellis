# Web Interface Pages

Trellis provides a web interface for managing your development environment.

## [Terminal](/docs/pages/terminal/)

The main view—access local terminals (@), service logs (#), log viewers (~), and remote windows (!) through the navigation picker.

## [Status](/docs/pages/status/)

Monitor all configured services—see which are running or stopped, start/stop individual services, or control all services at once.

## [Worktrees](/docs/pages/worktrees/)

Manage git worktrees—view status, create new worktrees, switch between them, and remove old ones.

## [Events](/docs/pages/events/)

View a timeline of system events including service starts, crashes, worktree switches, and workflow executions.

## [Crashes](/docs/pages/crashes/)

Review crash reports when services exit unexpectedly. View stack traces, exit codes, and related trace IDs.

## [Trace](/docs/pages/trace/)

Execute distributed traces across multiple log sources to correlate events by trace ID or request ID.
